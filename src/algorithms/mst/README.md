### Minimum Spanning Trees (MST)
This module contains various implementations of minimum spanning tree implementations.

A minimum spanning tree works on an undirected graph where the edges have been given positive weights.
A spanning tree is a subgraph of such a graph that is connected and acyclic, and also includes all 
vertices (spanning).

The goal is to find the minimum weight spanning tree.
